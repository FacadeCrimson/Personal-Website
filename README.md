### About


This master branch stores the source code for my personal website which is hosted on GitHub. The built app code is on gh-pages branch. You can visit my website directly from my personal domain simontan.com.

This website is built completely using React. With careful tuning of CSS and Javascript, I believe that it looks perfect. But if you find any subtle inconcistencies, don't hesitate to submit your opinion through the form on the webpage!
